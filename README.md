# MeteoriteLandings
A sample iOS project displaying JSON data on meteorite landings over time.

This project uses Swift's native JSON decoding capabilities to read from a JSON file and present data to the user.
While protocols exist to both encode and decode data (to and from JSON format), this example only focuses on decoding.
